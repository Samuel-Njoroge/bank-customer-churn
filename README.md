# **Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model**

## **Problem Statement.**
Rated Bank, a financial institution, aims to solve their challenge of customers churning. Their current architecture entails sending raw data from their on-premises database to Azure Blob Storage.

## Solution
This project implements a machine learning model to predict customer churn for Rated Bank. It utilizes Azure cloud services for data storage, model training, and deployment.
